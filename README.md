# DesignPatterns

Design patterns are divided into three fundamental groups:
<ol>
<li>Creational</li>
<li>Behavioral</li>
<li>Structural</li>
</ol>

Creational patterns are focused towards how to instantiate an object or group of related objects.
Can be further divided into
<ol>
<li>class-creation - use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process.</li>
<li>object-creation - use delegation effectively to get the job done.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Abstract Factory - Creates an instance of several families of classes</li>
<li>Builder - Separates object construction from its representation</li>
<li>Factory - Creates an instance of several derived classes</li>
<li>Object Pool - Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use
</li>
<li>Prototype           A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned</li>
<li>Singleton           A class of which only a single instance can exist</li>
</ol>
